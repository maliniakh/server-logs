Running
    ./gradlew run --args="input_file.txt"


Notes
    I selected GSON as JSON parser, it seems to have good balance beween being lightweight and robust.
    Assumption is made that every file line is a separate JSON entry.
    Decided not to use Spring as DI, went for "manual" dependecy injection instead.
    I prefer not to use interfaces (for services etc.) without clear reason - same case here.
    JDBC connections are not being closed, as I didn't have enough time to figure how to handle that.
    A few additional remarks are present in the code as comments


Further improvements
    Add more test cases, for example with malformed input
    Improve error handling
        Probably introducing some project-specific exceptions is the way to go.
    Improved resiliancy - for example, currently a single wrong line leads to an exception and runtime termination
    Duration threshold could be made configurable.
    Using JDBC feels old-fashioned to say the least, it could be nice to improve it somehow.
    Adding some constraints is worth considering.
